# Final Project: Market Research on Product Ratings
In this final project we built 2 models that explores the ratings that each user would give to each product.
In the models we have:

* Load and prepare the "user_ratings.csv" and "user_history.csv" files for analysis
* create a csv file that contains 45000 X 75 lines with 3 columns in the same format as the "user_ratings.csv" and "user_history.csv"

## Model 1: SGD Regressor 








## Model 2: Keras Model
